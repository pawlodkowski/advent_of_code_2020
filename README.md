# Advent of Code, 2020

My solutions to the first 12 problems of the 2020 edition of [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2020).

_(though only the first halves of problems 11 and 12)_

I decided to stop after day 12, since solving the problems started to take up a bit too much of my personal time for my liking. However, it was fun and exhilarating (and at times, addicting) while it lasted! I'd say this certainly sharpened my algorithmics and programming skills.

Perhaps I'll come back to this at some point in 2021 to finish more of the challenges...

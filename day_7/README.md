### [Day 7: Handy Haversacks](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/7)

So far, I found Day 7 to be the most challenging puzzle of 2020 Advent of Code -- but also the
most rewarding.

I rarely use recursion in practice (nor do I find myself every really needing it for
anything), so I feel quite accomplished having successfully implemented it in this mind-bending
logic problem. For that reason I decided to really clean up my solution and document my code fairly
thoroughly. Hopefully when I revisit this in the future I'll be able to again appreciate my approach.
